# Student-Performance-Prediction
Overview
This project demonstrates the application of regularization techniques in machine learning models to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. The primary focus is on methods such as L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization applied in a predictive modeling context.

Features
- Implements regularization techniques to optimize machine learning models.
- Visualizes the effects of regularization on model performance.
- Demonstrates usage on a sample dataset with clearly explained steps.

Requirements
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries/Dependencies:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn

Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/regularization-demo.git
   cd regularization-demo
2. Install the required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook regularization.ipynb
2. Execute the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train models with and without regularization.
   - Analyze the results with visualizations.

How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Load sample data, handle missing values, and normalize features.
2. Model Training:
   - Train models with L1 and L2 regularization.
3. Visualization:
   - Plot the effects of regularization parameters on model coefficients and performance metrics.

File Structure
- regularization.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the project implementation.
- data/: Contains sample datasets (if applicable).
- README.md: Project documentation.

Results
- L1 regularization (Lasso) reduces the number of non-zero coefficients, leading to feature selection.
- L2 regularization (Ridge) minimizes the magnitude of coefficients, reducing overfitting.
